Even when I report them through support, the response is always that it\\'s enough in-game, but I continue to lose against cheaters. This is incredibly frustrating, especially when losing points in premier.\\n\\nI recommend that Premier Points and stats should not be affected when playing against cheaters. It seems like the developers don‚Äôt care about the players‚Äô frustration, which is ruining the game. You are hurting the community.\\n\\nI‚Äôve been playing CS since 1999, but the lack of action against cheaters is disappointing. Cheaters are not being banned, and players don‚Äôt get notifications about bans, unlike games such as PUBG. Losing to cheaters feels like a waste of time.\\n\\nDeathmatches and Premier mode are both filled with cheaters, and Valve‚Äôs anti-cheat system is not effective. At the very least, use AI to detect player behavior and flag potential cheaters for investigation. Watching replays makes it clear when someone is cheating.\\n\\nWhy do I pay the price for developers‚Äô failure to fix cheaters? If Valve can‚Äôt fix this, at least implement a fair system, like Rainbow Six Siege, where players get points back when cheaters ruin the game. A typical match in CS2 lasts 30-50 minutes, including overtime‚Äîam I just playing to waste my time?\\n\\nI want to achieve a high Premier Rank, but it\\'s impossible when lower ping players dominate. I don‚Äôt like shooting at a player‚Äôs head when they‚Äôre not even on my screen. Ping differences are a huge problem. For instance, with 68ms, I shouldn\\'t have to play against someone with 1ms, which gives them an unfair advantage. Recoil and hitboxes aren\\'t the same for everyone, making the game feel unbalanced.\\n\\nAt the very least, implement an MMR system based on ping‚Äîsubtract 35ms from the player\\'s current ping. I‚Äôd be okay with a 30ms difference, but anything more, like a 20ms advantage, changes the outcome of the game. My bullets don‚Äôt register properly, and I get killed due to the difference.\\n\\nAnd then there‚Äôs support‚Äîwhen I report cheaters, I sometimes include a YouTube link to the video of them cheating. And what does support say? \"We can‚Äôt open the YouTube link.\" Are you telling me to just shut up? Really? It\\'s YouTube, come on! This is a vital tool to provide clear evidence, and they can‚Äôt even open it? If your platform can\\'t provide a clean way to view replays or get media over 10MB, at least accept YouTube links.\\n\\nUntil these issues are addressed, the game will continue to feel unfair for me and other players, we all love when its a fair and clean game BUT NOT WITH CHEATERS... is there any cheat business out there!!!!!', 'timestamp_created': 1742299816, 'timestamp_updated': 1742301338, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 4, 'votes_funny': 0, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.565217375755310059', 'comment_count': 1, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}, {'recommendationid': '189591719', 'author': {'steamid': '76561199828349812', 'num_games_owned': 1, 'num_reviews': 1, 'playtime_forever': 8489, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 2840, 'playtime_at_review': 4253, 'last_played': 1742930177}, 'language': 'english', 'review': 'very fun game my teamates is spining around and hits every shot.\\nwon my firs ever game 13:0 with 0 damage. 10\\\\10 would not recommend', 'timestamp_created': 1741354537, 'timestamp_updated': 1741354537, 'voted_up': False, 'votes_up': 6, 'votes_funny': 2, 'weighted_vote_score': '0.56313091516494751', 'comment_count': 6, 'steam_purchase': True, 'received_for_free': False, 'written_during_early_access': False, 'primarily_steam_deck': False}, {'recommendationid': '190607559', 'author': {'steamid': '76561198096715674', 'num_games_owned': 76, 'num_reviews': 2, 'playtime_forever': 161261, 'playtime_last_two_weeks': 1304, 'playtime_at_review': 160655, 'last_played': 1742971688}, 'language': 'english', 'review': '[h1]Counter-Strike 2 ‚Äì Not Bad. But the DLC, Operations, Anti-Cheat, No More Predatory Gambling, and the New DLC Gamemodes?? Actually Fantastic.[/h1]\\n\\nOkay, so I think I might be one of the few who‚Äôs actually enjoying this more than Global Offensive. Maybe it‚Äôs because of the new engine, maybe it‚Äôs because of the DLC & Operations, or maybe just because CS2 finally feels fresh. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthe DLC is what really makes this game stand out. The DLC maps? Easily some of the best added in years, making every match feel less repetitive. The DLC skins? Gorgeous. And the DLC gamemodes? This is what really sets CS2 apart from CS:GO‚Äîthere‚Äôs finally variety.  \\n\\nGunplay is still as solid as ever, but the DLC weapons add just enough variety without breaking balance. And the DLC character models? They actually look great this time‚Äîno more weird CS:GO agent skins that didn‚Äôt fit the style. The DLC animations? A massive improvement‚Äîeverything feels smoother, more polished. Even the DLC-exclusive cosmetics feel like they actually put effort into them instead of just throwing in random skins.  \\n\\nBUT THE ANTI-CHEAT, THOUGH. Finally, Valve did something. VAC Live actually bans cheaters mid-match, which is both hilarious and a game-changer. No more wasting 30 minutes only to get destroyed by a spinbotter. And the DLC anti-cheat updates? Matchmaking actually feels fair now. They even cancel the match if a cheater is caught, so you don‚Äôt lose your rank. Honestly, this alone makes CS2 ten times better than CS:GO ever was. Plus, the DLC operations introduce more ways to play that don‚Äôt just feel like a grind.  \\n\\nAnd FINALLY, something I‚Äôve been asking for for YEARS: they got rid of the predatory gambling mechanics. And the best part? The DLC content doesn‚Äôt rely on loot boxes. No more random gambling disguised as fun. The game is actually about skill and gameplay now, not just a casino wrapped in an FPS. The DLC packs actually give you what you pay for, instead of making you roll the dice. This is a huge win, and it‚Äôs about time Valve actually listened to me.  \\n\\nAnd the best part? The DLC added so many new gamemodes. Classic competitive is still the main focus, but now we‚Äôve got real variety. The DLC 2D RPG mode? Perfect if you want a break from ranked. The DLC tactical ops mode? A cool twist on the usual bomb defusal. And my personal favorite, the DLC co-op missions‚Äîactually fun, well-designed, and worth playing. Instead of just running the same matches over and over, the DLC gamemodes finally make CS2 feel complete.  \\n\\nMatchmaking still has some issues, but at least the DLC Operation playlists give us new ways to play. Also, the DLC casual mode actually feels structured instead of just a warm-up for ranked. DLC Operation missions are way more interesting, not just boring ‚Äúplant the bomb 67 times‚Äù challenges. The DLC content in general just adds so much more to do.  \\n\\nOverall, it‚Äôs still Counter-Strike at its core, but the DLC, Operations, Anti-Cheat improvements, the removal of predatory loot boxes, and the incredible variety of new gamemodes make it feel better than ever. If you didn‚Äôt like CS:GO before, this probably won‚Äôt change your mind‚Äîbut for me? The DLC alone makes it worth playing! \\n\\n[h2]Base game? 6/10.

It was raw, it was broken, and it was glorious. Despite its jank, the thrill of that chicken dinner kept me coming back for over 4,400 hours‚Äîstreaming, participating in community events, and witnessing some of the best and worst moments a battle royale could offer.\\n\\nBut after eight long years, I must admit... PUBG has finally won. Not as a refined, polished, thrilling experience. No, it won by outlasting its players, grinding us down, and mutating into something unrecognizable‚Äîa desperate, free-to-play mobile game in disguise, where the only thing dropping faster than me in Pochinki is my respect for the devs.\\n\\nBattle Passes, Gambling, and the Art of Selling Out\\nRemember when PUBG‚Äôs battle passes were actually fun? They gave meaningful rewards, they were challenging, and they made you feel like you were progressing in something other than just your debt to loot box addiction. Now, every pass is just another overpriced chore list, rehashed quests rewarding you with a currency system so complicated it probably qualifies as an economics degree.\\n\\nAnd just when I thought the game couldn‚Äôt stoop any lower, PUBG Studios went, ‚ÄúHold my G-Coin.‚Äù This year, they introduced a full-on casino aesthetic‚Äîslot machines, lucky spins, and randomized G-Coin loot boxes. This isn\\'t even trying to hide the gambling mechanics anymore; it‚Äôs just straight-up waving a neon ‚ÄúInsert Credit Card‚Äù sign in your face. What started as a battle royale has become a glorified slot machine with occasional gunfights in between microtransactions.\\n\\nCheaters and Anti-Cheat: A Never-Ending Love Story\\nLet‚Äôs talk about the real MVPs of PUBG‚Äîthe cheaters. They‚Äôve been here since the beginning, they‚Äôre more dedicated than the devs, and somehow they‚Äôre still outnumbering players in some lobbies. PUBG says they ban thousands of accounts every week, but fun fact: I still get lasered from 500m away by some dude named ‚ÄúFreeChickenHacks‚Äù who made his account 10 minutes ago.\\n\\nMeanwhile, casual players and content creators get the cold shoulder. Want better matchmaking for newcomers? Nope. Want proper streamer support? Good luck. Want an esports revival? Forget it. PUBG Studios has made it clear: money comes first, community second, and game integrity somewhere in the negatives.\\n\\nPUBG 2.0? Or Just More Broken Promises?\\nThere‚Äôs been talk of PUBG 2.0 for years, with devs hinting at major overhauls and Unreal Engine 5 upgrades. But after all this time, all we‚Äôve seen is a mountain of paid skins and another unfinished roadmap. Rumors say something‚Äôs in the works, but knowing PUBG Studios, it‚Äôll either be:\\nA) Another cash grab\\nB) Some half-baked side project no one asked for\\nC) An actual improvement (but only available in the premium pass, obviously)\\n\\nConclusion: \"A Love Story Gone Wrong\"\\nPUBG was special. Even when it was janky, frustrating, and occasionally unplayable, it had soul. The tension, the firefights, the last-circle heart-pounding moments‚Äîit was an experience. But now? Now, it‚Äôs just another corporate product, desperately clinging to life with monetization schemes and ignoring everything that made it great in the first place.\\n\\nAnd so, after eight years, I finally have to say it: Goodbye, PUBG. It feels like breaking up with a girl I once loved... except in this case, it‚Äôs more like a divorce that went really, really wrong.\\n\\nüíî 10/10 memories, 2/10 current game.
